============
Voting Nodes
============

Historia is the first cryptocurrency with a focus on a voting platform and 
file storage mechanism (IPFS) paired together to attempt to give an accurate 
consensus-based view of future history. These features are implemented on 
top of a network of masternodes and the IPFS network, which gives rise 
to many exciting features not available on conventional blockchains.

This documentation focuses on understanding the setup on a voting node to the network. 

**Option 1: Self-operated voting node**

Users that would like to setup a voting node should learn about how the 
voting system works, and to learn to setup a voting node from the Historia 
wallet. Several steps are required, and the user must assume responsibility 
for setting up, securing and maintaining both the collateral. See these 
pages for information on how to set up a voting node.
