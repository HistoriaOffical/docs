=============
What is Historia?
=============

Historia aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused
cryptocurrency in the world. The Historia network features 
:ref:`instant transaction confirmation <instantsend>`, double spend 
protection, :ref:`anonymity <privatesend>` equal to that of physical 
cash, a 
:ref:`self-governing, self-funding model <decentralized-governance>` 
driven by :ref:`incentivized full nodes <masternode-network>` and a 
`clear roadmap <https://github.com/HistoriaOffical/historia-roadmap>`_ for on-chain
scaling to up to 400MB blocks using custom-developed open source
hardware. While Historia is based on Bitcoin and compatible with many key
components of the Bitcoin ecosystem, its two-tier network structure
offers significant improvements in transaction speed, anonymity and
governance. This section of the documentation describes these and many
more key features that set Historia apart in the blockchain economy.
