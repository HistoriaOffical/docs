"Historia is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with a strong focus on"
" the payments industry. Historia offers a form of money that is portable, "
"inexpensive, divisible and fast. It can be spent securely both online and"
" in person with only minimal transaction fees. Based on the Bitcoin "
"project, Historia aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments "
"system in the world. In addition to Bitcoin's feature set, Historia currently"
" also offers instant transactions (:ref:`instantsend`), private "
"transactions (:ref:`privatesend`) and operates a self-governing and self-"
"funding model that enables the Historia network to pay individuals and "
"businesses for work that adds value to the network. This "
":ref:`decentralized governance and budgeting system <governance>` makes "
"it one of the first ever successful decentralized autonomous "
"organizations (DAO)."

"If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to "
"understand is that transactions occur directly between two parties "
"without any central authority to facilitate the transaction. This also "
"means that you are responsible for your own security - there is no bank "
"or credit card company to reverse a transaction if your funds are stolen "
"or lost. In this sense, it is similar to cash or gold, but cryptocurrency"
" can be spent locally and internationally with equal ease, if you are "
"confident you are sending funds to the right destination. For these "
"reasons, the Historia documentation has a strong focus on safety and "
"understanding the concepts and features that drive the Historia ecosystem. "
"The videos, links and documentation below can help you get started, or "
"use the table of contents on the left to find a specific topic of "
"interest."
