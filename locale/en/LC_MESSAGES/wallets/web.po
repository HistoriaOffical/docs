"`MyHistoriaWallet <https://myhistoriawallet.org/>`_ is a web interface to the "
"Historia blockchain, inspired by `MyEtherWallet "
"<https://www.myetherwallet.com>`_ and created by `DeltaEngine.net "
"<https://deltaengine.net/>`_. It is explicitly not an online wallet, "
"meaning you maintain control over your private keys at all times. Unlike "
"many other light wallets, MyHistoriaWallet also supports advanced Historia "
"features such as InstantSend and PrivateSend. The project is non-profit, "
"open source and free to use. You can load a wallet and transact in a "
"variety of wallet formats:"
