"Your Historia Core Wallet is associated with a number of unique addresses "
"that can be used to send and receive Historia. Each address holds its own "
"balance, and the sum of all your balances is what appears on the "
"**Overview** tab. When you send Historia, your wallet will automatically "
"transfer funds from as many of your addresses as necessary to the "
"destination address, which is controlled by another Historia user and "
"associated with their wallet. You can control which addresses you use "
"using the Coin Control feature."

"When you confirm a transaction, Historia Core will enter the transaction in a"
" block, which will then be added to the blockchain for other clients to "
"confirm. A transaction is generally considered confirmed once six blocks "
"have been added after the block containing your transaction, although "
"masternode and mining payments are only released after 101 blocks. Note "
"that a different process is used for InstantSend and PrivateSend "
"transactions."

"The other options relate to fees and PrivateSend/InstantSend. You can "

" or subtract it from the amount sent. You can also increase your fee to "
"encourage nodes on the network to prioritize your transaction. Choosing "
"**InstantSend** has a similar effect, but actually relies on a different "
"mechanism in the second layer network to speed up the transaction time. "
"Choosing **PrivateSend** will send Historia from an address that has "
"previously been mixed. You can find out more about PrivateSend and "
