"These videos show how to download, verify the checksum and install the "
"Historia Core Wallet on Linux, macOS and Windows systems. While they are "
"somewhat out of date, the procedure is still largely the same. The main "
"difference is that the official Historia website is now https://historia.network/"
" rather than https://www.HistoriaOffical.io/ as stated in the videos, although "
"the old site will redirect you to the new one. Also, in later versions of"
" Historia Core, application data such as the blockchain is now stored in the "
"\"HistoriaCore\" rather than \"Historia\" folder."
