"Historia aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused "
"cryptocurrency in the world. The Historia network features :ref:`instant "
"transaction confirmation <instantsend>`, double spend protection, "
"anonymity equal to that of physical cash, a self-governing, :ref:`self-"
"funding model <budget-system>` driven by :ref:`incentivized full nodes "
"<masternode-network>` and a `clear roadmap <https://github.com/HistoriaOffical"
"/historia-roadmap>`__ for on-chain scaling to up to 400MB blocks using "
"custom-developed open source hardware. While Historia is based on Bitcoin and"
" compatible with many key components of the Bitcoin ecosystem, its two-"
"tier network structure offers significant improvements in transaction "
"speed, anonymity and governance. This section of the documentation "
"describes these and many more key features that set Historia apart in the "
"blockchain economy. For full details, please read the `Historia whitepaper "
"<https://github.com/HistoriaOffical/historia/wiki/Whitepaper>`__."
