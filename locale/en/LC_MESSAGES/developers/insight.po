"The open-source Historia Insight REST API provides you with a convenient, "
"powerful and simple way to read data from the Historia network and build your"
" own services with it. Simple HTTP endpoints exist for all common "
"operations on the Historia blockchain familiar from the Bitcore Insight API, "
"as well as Historia-specific features such as InstantSend transactions, "
"budget proposals, sporks and the masternode list. This documentation "
"describes how to set up the `Historia Insight API <https://github.com/historiaevo"
"/insight-api>`__ server and (optionally) the `Historia Insight UI "
"<https://github.com/historiaevo/insight-ui>`__ block explorer."
