"Gitian is the deterministic build process that is used to build the Historia "
"Core executables. It provides a way to be reasonably sure that the "
"executables are really built from the source on GitHub. It also makes "
"sure that the same, tested dependencies are used and statically built "
"into the executable. Multiple developers build the source code by "
"following a specific descriptor (\"recipe\"), cryptographically sign the "
"result, and upload the resulting signature. These results are compared "
"and only if they match, the build is accepted and uploaded to historia.network."
