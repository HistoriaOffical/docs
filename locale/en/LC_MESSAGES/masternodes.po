"Historia is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with a strong focus on"
" the payments industry. Historia offers a form of money that is portable, "
"inexpensive, divisible and fast. It can be spent securely both online and"
" in person with only minimal transaction fees. Based on the Bitcoin "
"project, Historia aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments "
"system in the world. In addition to Bitcoin's feature set, Historia currently"
" also offers instant transactions (:ref:`instantsend`), private "
"transactions (:ref:`privatesend`) and operates a self-governing and self-"
"funding model that enables the Historia network to pay individuals and "
"businesses for work that adds value to the network. This decentralized "
"governance and budgeting system makes it one of the first ever successful"
" decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)."
