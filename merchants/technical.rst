Historia Wallet Integration
=======================

This documentation is also available as a `PDF
<https://github.com/HistoriaOffical/docs/raw/master/binary/merchants
/Integration-Resources-Wallet-Integration.pdf>`__.

`Historia Core <https://github.com/HistoriaOffical/historia/releases>`__ is a fork of
Bitcoin and the majority of functionality included in the Historia Core
Daemon can be integrated in a similar manner. Key differences relate to
customizations to existing JSON-RPC commands to support unique
functionalities such as InstantSend. These differences, as well as more
general information, are summarized below.

1. **General Information:** Historia is a “Proof of Work” blockchain with
   attributes similar to that of Bitcoin.

   a. Block Time: ~2.6 Minutes per Block
   b. Blockchain Confirmations: 6 Confirmations (or 1 in the case of 
      InstantSend)
   c. Github Source: https://github.com/HistoriaOffical/historia
   d. Release Link: https://github.com/HistoriaOffical/historia/releases

2. **JSON-RPC Interface:** The majority of Bitcoin JSON-RPC commands are
   unchanged making integration into existing systems relatively
   straightforward. For a complete listing of RPC commands see the 
   `Developer Guide <https://historia-docs.github.io/en/developer-guide>`__.

   It’s worth noting that several key Transaction-related JSON-RPC
   commands have been modified to support InstantSend through the
   addition of an “InstantLock” field and are listed below:

   a. `GetTransaction <https://historia-docs.github.io/en/developer-reference#gettransaction>`__
   b. `ListTransactions <https://historia-docs.github.io/en/developer-reference#listtransactions>`__
   c. `ListSinceBlock <https://historia-docs.github.io/en/developer-reference#listsinceblock>`__

3. **Block Hashing Algorithm:** Historia uses the “X11” algorithm in place
   of SHA256 used in Bitcoin. It’s important to note, however, that this
   only affects the hashing of the Block itself. All other internals
   utilize SHA256 hashes (transactions, merkle root, etc) which allows 
   for most existing libraries to work in the Historia ecosystem.

4. **Supporting Libraries:** Due to the aforementioned differences in
   Hashing Algorithm only minor adjustments are required before using
   Bitcoin libraries on the Historia network. The most popular libraries
   have already been ported to Historia which has enabled support for most
   major programming languages. These resources are outlined in the
   :ref:`SDK Resources <sdk-resources>` section of this document.

v0.13.0 Integration Notes
=========================

This documentation is also available as a `PDF <https://github.com/HistoriaOffical/docs/raw/master/binary/merchants/Integration-Resources-Historia-v0.13.0-Transaction-Types.pdf>`__.

Historia 0.13.0 implements `DIP002 Special Transactions <https://github.com/HistoriaOffical/dips/blob/master/dip-0002.md>`__, 
which form a basis for new transaction types that will provide on-chain
metadata to assist various consensus mechanisms. The following special
transaction types exist:

+---------+---------+------+----------------+---------+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Release | Version | Type | Payload Size   | Payload | Payload JSON | Transaction Purpose                                                                            |

Integration notes:

1. `DIP002 Special Transactions <https://github.com/HistoriaOffical/dips/blob/master/dip-0002.md>`__ 
   are a foundational component of Historia Core v0.13.0 and introduce a new
   Transaction Version and related “Payload” to the network.

2. Integrated Systems must be able to `serialize and deserialize <https://github.com/HistoriaOffical/dips/blob/master/dip-0002.md#serialization-hashing-and-signing>`__ 
   these new Transaction Types in order to accurately encode and decode
   Raw Transaction data.

3. From a `backwards compatibility <https://github.com/HistoriaOffical/dips/blob/master/dip-0002.md#compatibility>`__ 
   perspective, the 4 byte (32-bit) ``version`` field included in Legacy
   Transactions has been split into two fields: ``version`` and ``type``
   (each consisting of 2 bytes).

4. `InstantSend <https://docs.historia.network/en/latest/merchants/technical.html#instantsend>`__ 
   status and Payload JSON (e.g. ``proRegTx``) is included in the 
   JSON-RPC response, please note that this data is not part of the
   calculated hash and is provided for convenience.

Legacy transaction structure::

  {
    "txid": <string>,
    "size": <int>,
    "version": 2,
    "locktime": 0,
    "vin": [],
    "vout": [ … ]
  }

Updated transaction structure::

  {
    "txid": <string>,
    "size": <int>,
    "version": 3,
    "type": <int>,
    "locktime": 0,
    "vin": [ … ],
    "vout": [ … ],
    "extraPayloadSize": <variable int>,
    "extraPayload": …
  }

See the `Special Transactions developer documentation <https://historia-docs.github.io/en/developer-reference#special-transactions>`__ 
for additional detail on these data types, e.g. ``<variable int>``. See 
the `v0.13.0 transaction types integration documentation (PDF) <https://github.com/HistoriaOffical/docs/raw/master/binary/merchants/Integration-Resources-Historia-v0.13.0-Transaction-Types.pdf>`__
for worked examples of each transaction type.

InstantSend
===========

This documentation is also available as a `PDF
<https://github.com/HistoriaOffical/docs/raw/master/binary/merchants
/Integration-Resources-InstantSend.pdf>`__.

InstantSend is a feature provided by the Historia network that allows for
0-confirmation transactions to be safely accepted by Merchants and other
service providers. Secured by the Masternode Network, this mechanism
eliminates the risk of a “Double Spend” by locking transaction inputs
for a given transaction at a protocol level.


InstantSend Transactions vs. Standard Transactions
--------------------------------------------------

From an integration perspective there are only minor differences between
an InstantSend Transaction and a Standard Transaction. Both transaction
types are formed in the same way and are signed using the same process;
the key difference is the fee structure and input requirements for
InstantSend. 

#. Fee Structure: InstantSend utilizes a “per-input” fee of 0.0001 HISTORIA
   per Input.
#. Input Requirements: All inputs for an InstantSend transaction must
   have at least 6 confirmations.

In the event that a given transaction does not meet both criteria it
will revert to a standard transaction.

Receiving InstantSend Transactions
----------------------------------

InstantSend transactions are handled in the same way as a Standard
Transaction, typically through JSON-RPC, Insight API, or an internal
notification script / service that is configured at a server level.

#. JSON-RPC: The following RPC commands will include InstantSend-related
   information. Within the response you’ll find an “InstantLock” field
   the status of a given Transaction. This true/false (boolean) value
   will indicate whether an InstantSend has been observed.

   a. GetTransaction: https://historia-docs.github.io/en/developer-reference#gettransaction 
   b. ListTransactions: https://historia-docs.github.io/en/developer-reference#listtransactions 
   c. ListSinceBlock: https://historia-docs.github.io/en/developer-reference#listsinceblock 	

#. Insight API: Insight API can be used to detect InstantSend
   transactions and to push notifications to clients using WebSockets.
   The API can also be manually polled to retrieve Transaction
   information including InstantSend status.

   a. Web Socket: https://github.com/historiaevo/insight-api#web-socket-api
   b. Transaction API: https://github.com/historiaevo/insight-api#instantsend-transactions

#. Script Notify: The Historia Core Daemon can be configured to execute an
   external script whenever an InstantSend transaction relating to that
   wallet is observed. This is configured by adding the following line
   to the historia.conf file:

   ``instantsendnotify=/path/to/concurrent/safe/handler %s``

   *Note that only addresses imported to the wallet will be monitored for
   InstantSend Transactions.*

Broadcasting InstantSend Transactions
-------------------------------------

InstantSend Transactions can be constructed and broadcast using an
approach similar to Standard Transactions. Provided the InstantSend Fee
Structure and Input Requirements are met, an InstantSend can be
broadcast using JSON-RPC or Insight API as a Raw Transaction.

#. JSON-RPC: The “SendRawTransaction” RPC command can be utilized to
   broadcast a raw transaction using InstantSend. When utilizing this
   command be sure to set both optional parameters as “true”

   ``sendrawtransaction "hexstring" ( allowhighfees instantsend )``
   ``sendrawtransaction "hexstring" true true``

   More Information: https://historia-docs.github.io/en/developer-reference#sendrawtransaction 

#. Insight API: Raw Transactions can also be broadcast as an InstantSend
   using Insight API. In this case all that is required is to POST the
   raw transaction using the ``/tx/sendix`` route.

   More Information: https://github.com/historiaevo/insight-api#instantsend-transaction
