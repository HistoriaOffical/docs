Using the Create system for submission of a Proposal, Record, or Archive
========================================================================

How to make use of the Create module to submit a new proposal, record, or archive.

Before you begin
================

This guide assumes you have already setup an account on the https://historia.network web application or have already setup your Historia Local Web Application (HLWA). If you haven't done one of those things, please do that before you use this guide.


How to use the Create system
----------------------------

The Historia Network developers have tried to make this process as simple as possible for the users.

After you have registered your user on Web App (https://historia.network/). Note: If you are using the Historia Local Web App you do not need to register an account. 

Login to the Web App application and go to Create, as highlighted below.

Once you click on Create, the web application will ask you which type of object you would like the create. Please choose one of the options.

The options available:

Proposal - This is a temporary object that makes a suggestion to the network. This could be an idea for future development or a user requested payment for some idea the user wants to implement themselves, such as a new template, marketing, or other services that will help to grow the Historia Network. If a proposal passes, the user will receive payment and the proposal object will eventually be deleted from the network after the expiration date.

Record - This is a permanent object such as a historical event or something that should be permanent added to the Historia Network blockchain. If a record object passes with enough votes, the user will receive payment and the record object will be locked on the network. If it does not pass, it will be deleted from the blockchain after the expiration date.

Archive - An archive is a subset of a record object with the same behavior from a voting perpsective with regards to blockchain locks. When choosing an archive object, this will trigger functionality within the web application to archive an external web page

If you choose a Proposal or Record object you will be asked if you would like to import a template to work off of, as seen below::

It is recommended that you use a template, unless you have enough skill to create a custom page.

Once it loads the Create Builder interface there is much going on here as seen below

Key for above screen shot:

1. Type of object you are working on
2. End Cycle Date - This is the date of the next superblock and payment to any passing objects. It's recommended that you submit your object with at much voting time left possible to gain votes.
3. Next Payment Date - How many days left before the next superblock and payment to any passing objects
4. Voting Deadline Date - How many days left that masternodes and voting nodes have to vote on this proposal. The last two days of the cycle nodes can not vote.
5. Currently Passing - This is the total amount of of HTA for the objects that have enough votes to pass currently. If too much HTA allocated to pass in the current cycle, your object may not be paid even if it passes.
6. Total Available Budget - This is the total amount of HTA avaiable for objects per month.
7. Name - This is the name that will be seen on the blockchain of your object.
8. Summary - This is the summary that will be seen on the blockchain of your object.
9. Reward Address - This is YOUR address that you want coins to be paid to, if your object has enough votes to pass.
10. Reward Amount Requested - The amount you are requesting if your object passes
11. Editor - This is where you can edit the content of your object.
12. Editor Toolbar - This is where you can change formatting and create your object.
13. Save Button - This button allows you to save a draft without submitting your object to the blockchain. Your work it not automatically saved. Save often.
14. Delete Draft - This button will delete this draft.
15. Submit Button - Once you are complete and are ready to submit your object for a vote hit this button. Note, after you hit this button you will not be able to make changes.

After you hit the submit button, you will be asked for payment for your object as seen below.

After the payment is received your object has been submitted to the network. It may take up to 1 hour for the blockchain to process and sync your object for vote.
