========================================================================
Using the Create system for submission of a Proposal, Record, or Archive
========================================================================

How to make use of the Create module to submit a new proposal, record, or archive.

Before you begin
================

This guide assumes you have already setup an account on the https://historia.network web application or have already setup your Historia Local Web Application (HLWA). If you haven't done one of those things, please do that before you use this guide.


How to use the Create system (Record or Proposal)
=================================================

The Historia Network developers have tried to make this process as simple as possible for the users.

After you have registered your user on Web App (https://historia.network/). Note: If you are using the Historia Local Web App you do not need to register an account. 

Login to the Web App application and go to Create, as highlighted below.

The options available:

Proposal - A proposal is a temporary object that lets voters decide the direction of the Historia Network and this application. If a proposal passes, the Historia developers will do our best to follow the will of the voters. All proposals will expire and be deleted from the decentralized network. Things that could be submitted as proposals listed below:

- You have a good idea, are willing to do the work, and want to get paid in HTA.
- Directions to the developers on content
- Ideas on marketing
- Directions on development or new features

Record - A record is a object that if the voters approve, then will be a permanently added to the network. Once added, the record can never be altered, edited, or deleted by anybody, including the developers. It is 100% impossible as the records exist on in a decentralized database that no one person owns or controls. Things that could be submitted as records listed below:

- A current event
- Wiki content
- Useful information that should always be maintained forever.

Archive - An archive is a subset of a record object with the same behavior from a voting perpsective with regards to blockchain locks. When choosing an archive object, this will trigger functionality within the web application to archive an external web page.

If you choose a Proposal or Record object you will be asked if you would like to import a template to work off of, as seen below.

It is recommended that you use a template, unless you have enough skill to create a custom page.

Once Create Builder interface loads there is much going on here as seen below

Key for above screen shot:

1. Type of object you are working on
2. End Cycle Date - This is the date of the next superblock and payment to any passing objects. It's recommended that you submit your object with at much voting time left possible to gain votes.
3. Next Payment Date - How many days left before the next superblock and payment to any passing objects
4. Voting Deadline Date - How many days left that masternodes and voting nodes have to vote on this proposal. The last two days of the cycle nodes can not vote.
5. Currently Passing - This is the total amount of HTA for the objects that have enough votes to pass currently. If too much HTA is allocated to pass in the current cycle, your object may not be paid even if it passes. This field is important to consider when putting in a object.
6. Total Available Budget - This is the total amount of HTA available for objects per month.
7. Name - This is the name that will be seen on the blockchain of your object.
8. Summary - This is the summary that will be seen on the blockchain of your object.
9. Reward Address - This is YOUR address that you want coins to be paid to, if your object has enough votes to pass.
10. Reward Amount Requested - The amount you are requesting if your object passes.
11. Editor - This is where you can edit the content of your object.
12. Editor Toolbar - This is where you can change formatting and create your object. Please get familar with this, as there is much involved here.
13. Save Button - This button allows you to save a draft without submitting your object to the blockchain. Your work it not automatically saved. Save often.
14. Delete Draft - This button will delete this draft.
15. Submit Button - Once you are complete and are ready to submit your object for a vote hit this button. Note, after you hit this button you will not be able to make changes.


After you hit the submit button, you will be asked for payment for your object as seen below.

After the payment is received your object has been submitted to the network. It may take up to 1 hour for the blockchain to process and sync your object for vote.
