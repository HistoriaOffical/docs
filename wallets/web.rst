`MyHistoriaWallet <https://myhistoriawallet.org/>`_ is a web interface to the
Historia blockchain, inspired by `MyEtherWallet
<https://www.myetherwallet.com>`_ and created by `DeltaEngine.net
<https://deltaengine.net/>`_. It is explicitly not an online wallet,
meaning you maintain control over your private keys at all times. Unlike
many other light wallets, MyHistoriaWallet also supports advanced Historia
features such as InstantSend and PrivateSend. The project is non-profit,
open source and free to use. You can load a wallet and transact in a
variety of wallet formats:

- Keystore wallet (file-based)
- Ledger hardware wallet
- Trezor hardware wallet
- Private key
- BIP39/44 HD recovery phrase (coming soon)
- BIP32 HD recovery phrase (coming soon)

MyHistoriaWallet offers complete and detailed documentation for all functions.
